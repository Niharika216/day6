    <h1>Sunrisers Hyderabad</h1>
    <p>
      Sunrisers Hyderabad (stylised as SunRisers Hyderabad, abbr. SRH) are a
      professional franchise cricket team based in Hyderabad, Telangana, India,
      that plays in the Indian Premier League (IPL).The franchise is owned by
      Kalanithi Maran of the SUN Group and was founded in 2012 after the
      Hyderabad-based Deccan Chargers were terminated by the IPL.The team is
      currently coached by Daniel Vettori and captained by Pat Cummins. Their
      primary home ground is the Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium in
      Hyderabad, which has a capacity of 39,000.The team made their first IPL
      appearance in 2013, where they reached the playoffs, eventually finishing
      in fourth place. The Sunrisers won their maiden IPL title in the 2016
      season, defeating the Royal Challengers Bangalore by 8 runs in the final.
      The team has qualified for the play-off stage of the tournament for five
      consecutive seasons between 2016 and 2020. In 2018, the team reached the
      finals of the Indian Premier League, but lost to Chennai Super Kings. In
      2024, the team reached the finals of the Indian Premier League, but lost
      to Kolkata Knight Riders. The team was considered one of the best bowling
      sides, often admired for its ability to defend low totals, but now has
      shifted to a remarkable batting side, according to many cricket pundits.
      The team also holds the record for the highest-ever IPL total with 287
      runs.David Warner is the leading run scorer for the side, having won the
      Orange Cap three times, in 2015, 2017, and 2019. Bhuvneshwar Kumar is the
      leading wicket-taker having won the Purple Cap twice, in 2016 and 2017.The
      COVID-19 pandemic impacted the brand value of the Sunrisers Hyderabad
      which saw a decline of 4 percent to US$57.4 million in 2020 as the overall
      brand value of the IPL decreased to US$4.4 billion, according to Brand
      Finance.

      wicket-takers for the Sunrisers Hyderabad. Quite expectedly, he has also
      been the leader of the SRH pace attack in the past and will be one of the
      bowling mainstays for the franchise. Bhuvneshwar has a massive haul of 142
