      On March 12, 2022 the former RCB Skipper, Virat Kohli announced that he
      would be passing on the baton tow Faf du Plessis, who will be the new
      Captain for the RCB. It will be an all new setup, change in team colours
      for Faf du Plessis who will be representing the RCB the 2022 edition of
      the league. The veteran batter from South Africa was bought by the RCB for
      INR 7 crore at the IPL 2022 Mega Auction. Faf du Plessis started his IPL
      journey with the CSK and has played for them ever since. The right-handed
      batter played an all-important knock in the Finals of the 2021 edition of
      the league, scoring 86 runs off 59 deliveries, thereby winning the Player
      of the Match for the same. In 2018, Punjab Kings bought Faf for INR 1.6cr,
      but but CSK trumped them by using their RTM card and it sure was a bargain
      for them. While the classy and composed batsman did not get many outings
      in the RPS squad where he was picked up in the IPL player draft, du
      Plessis had consistent performances for CSK wherein he went on to have a
      very successful debut season scoring 398 runs. He impressed with a
      half-century on his ODI debut, against India and soon enough, found
      himself in South Africa's squad for the 2011 World Cup. With a century on
      Test debut against Australia, du Plessis has shed the tag of a
      limited-overs specialist. Although batting remains his area of prowess, du
      Plessis can come up with a few handy leg-spinners when required. To boot
      that, he is a livewire in the field, hence, making him a perfect T20
      package for any captain.
