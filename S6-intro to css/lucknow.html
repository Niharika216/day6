    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      The fans of Lucknow Super Giants - the newest franchise in the IPL – will
      pin their hopes on this man as the team looks to set the ball rolling and
      make their mark in their maiden IPL season. LSG picked KL Rahul – one of
      the finest - batters of the modern era to the board via draft and made him
      their captain. While Rahul, who was earlier leading Punjab Kings, will
      have a new set of players at his disposal, he will be out to lead from the
      front and bring the best out of his new teammates. KL Rahul has over 3200
      IPL runs to his name and his run-tally from the last four seasons (recent
      first) read: 626, 670, 593 and 659. The stylish yet destructive
      right-hander also holds the record for the highest individual score by an
      Indian batsman in the IPL. He has been a pillar for the Indian team across
      formats and it will not be any different when he sets foot on the field
      for LSG.

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      An attractive batter, a clean striker of the cricket ball and someone who
      is an able wicketkeeper. Nicholas Pooran generated a bidding war at the
      players auction and made his way to LSG, who shelled out a whopping INR 16
      Crore to have him on board. The left-handed batter from West Indies has so
      far played 47 IPL games and has over 900 runs with a strike rate over 150.
      His addition to the LSG unit will add more firepower to the team's batting
      unit.

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      LSG brought Naveen Ul Haq on board, spending INR 50 Lakh. The Afghanistan
      bowler is just 23-years-old but has a bagful of T20 experience, having
      played 132 T20s and scalping 160 wickets. He will be looking to shine in
      his maiden IPL season.

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      LSG brought the young Vidarbha pacer on board for INR 45 Lakh. Yash is yet
      to make his IPL debut but has played 37 T20s, scalping 55 wickets. He will
      be looking forward to making an impact with the ball in the upcoming
      edition of the TATA IPL.

    <img id="ayush" src="./images/lucknow/ayush.png" />
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      The youngster was brought on board by LSG for INR 20 Lac during the TATA
      IPL 2022 auction. While he does not have a lot of experience, Ayush Badoni
      will be keen to make the most of his time at the franchise and learn from
      some of the finest of the game.

    <img id="krunal" src="./images/lucknow/krunal.png" />
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      The Sr. Pandya brother is never out of the game be it with the ball in
      hand or with the bat. If not, he makes sure he contributes in the field.
      Krunal has grown in confidence and has a knack of performing under
      pressure as he did on the night of the final when Mumbai won their third
      title in 2017. He hit the winning runs in the 2020 season that gave MI
      their fifth title. While he is no longer with MI after being bought by LSG
      for INR 8.25 Crore, he will remain a valuable member for the new IPL
      entrant and will be required of playing the dual role of picking wickets
      with his left-arm spin and providing a boost to the middle order.
