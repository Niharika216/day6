    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      Captain Marvellous. Rohit Sharma has etched his name as the most
      successful captain in the IPL with five trophies, the most by anyone in
      the tournament. He has cracked the code and made MI the most consistent
      team. A prolific run-getter, the Hitman is one of the most naturally
      gifted batsmen in the world and has been enjoying a tremendous run with
      the bat. When it comes to the shorter format, there are few who can match
      his striking abilities. Rohit proved why he is regarded as a special
      talent when he became the first batsman to strike two double centuries in
      the ODIs and he now has three. He was one of the most consistent Deccan
      Chargers batsmen in the first three seasons of the IPL and was
      instrumental in his former franchise winning the crown in 2009 However,
      since 2011, Rohit has been an integral part of the Mumbai Indians guiding
      their batting line-up. He took over the team's captaincy a couple of games
      into the 2013 season and led MI to their maiden IPL title. In the same
      year, MI also completed a grand double when they clinched the Champions
      League T20 title. His captaincy was put to test in the 2015 season after
      the team won just one of their first six games and were struggling to stay
      afloat. Mumbai Indians then staged a remarkable turnaround and lifted the
      Trophy for the second time with a convincing win in the final. Rohit, who
      made a half-century, was named the Player of the Match. The legacy of
      Hitman expanded further on, after powering Mumbai Indians to title
      victories in the 2017 and 2019 seasons, both being last ball thrillers.
      Rohit led the Mumbai Indians to a successful campaign in the 2020 season,
      which was their second consecutive title. MI did not qualify for playoffs
      in the 14th season and will be raring to go this time. He now returns as
      Team India's full-time captain in all three formats of the game.

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      Consistent performances year after year has helped Suryakumar Yadav
      establish himself as one of India's premium white-ball batsmen. He has
      made a splash ever since he returned to Mumbai Indians for the 11th season
      of the IPL. Bought for INR 3.2 crore, the Mumbai batsman used his ample
      knowledge of the Wankhede Stadium pitch and made full use of the
      opportunities given to him. In a season where they failed to qualify for
      the playoffs, Suryakumar shone with his performances at the top of the
      order. Asked to open the batting, Suryakumar excelled in his role and
      scored over 500 runs in 2018, including four fifties. Used as a
      middle-order by Kolkata Knight Riders, Suryakumar's new role with MI was a
      game-changer. Facing the new ball, he has looked at ease and handled the
      situation well. Playing as per the situation, Suryakumar was able to
      change gears and even played patiently when the situation demanded. In
      2019, he amassed 424 runs to be MI's second-highest run-getter. He
      outperformed himself in the 2020 season scoring 480 runs at a strike rate
      of 145 and went on to make his T20 International debut later for India. It
      wasn't a surprise for anyone when he smashed the deliveries right from
      ball one and scored an magnificent fifty that resembled confidence. Just
      how much he is valued by MI was proved ahead of the auction when he was
      retained by the franchise. Much of MI's success this season will depend on
      how Suryakumar goes about his business.

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      It was a toss-up between the reliable Aditya Tare and the explosive Ishan
      Kishan ahead of the 11th season and Mumbai Indians opted for Kishan. From
      that day till now, nothing really has changed and Ishan's stocks have only
      soared. The Mumbai Indians didn't want to let him go and pulled out all
      stops as they spent a whopping 15.25 crore to have him back. It was the
      most expensive buy at the mega auction ahead of IPL 15. Now that Ishan
      returns home, the MI will count on him to carry on his aggressive approach
      and give the team the kind of starts required in the powerplay.
