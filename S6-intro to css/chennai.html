    <h1>Chennai Super Kings</h1>
    <p>
      Chennai Super Kings (CSK) is an Indian professional cricket franchise
      based in Chennai, Tamil Nadu. The team competes in the Indian Premier
      League (IPL) and was one of the eight franchises incorporated when the
      league was established in 2008. The team plays its home matches at the M.
      A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai and is owned by Chennai Super Kings
      Cricket Limited. Super Kings is the joint-most successful IPL franchise
      having won five IPL titles (shared with Mumbai Indians). In the IPL, they
      have appeared in a record 10 finals and qualified for the playoff stages
      12 times out of the 15 seasons they have played, more than any other team.
      Super Kings have also won the Champions League Twenty20 twice in 2010 and
      2014. The team is currently captained by Ruturaj Gaikwad and coached by
      Stephen Fleming. The team was suspended for two years from the IPL
      starting July 2015 due to the involvement of its owners in the 2013 IPL
      betting case. Super Kings re-joined IPL for the 2018 season and won the
      title in its comeback season. The team has a significant fan following. In
      January 2022, CSK became India's first unicorn sports enterprise. As of
      2022, it was the second most valuable IPL franchise with a valuation of
      $1.15 billion.

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      MS Dhoni added another feather to his cap in 2021 edition of the league as
      CSK won their fourth title. Ahead of the 2022 edition of the league, MS
      Dhoni was one of the four retained players by the franchise and he was
      retained for a sum of INR 12 crore. A batting powerhouse, MS Dhoni
      possesses the ability to destroy different bowling attacks on his own. The
      calmness and composure in his demeanor along with a sharp cricketing brain
      accounts for a lethal combination on the cricketing field and the
      glistening silverware in the trophy cabinets at CSK are a testimony to his
      extraordinary leadership skills. He was the face of Chennai Super Kings
      for the first eight editions of the league, leading them to two titles
      (2010 & 2011) and four runner-up finishes. He then became the first player
      to be drafted by Rising Pune Supergiant in the ninth edition of the
      league. And, he once again became the first player to be retained by CSK
      ahead of the IPL Player Auction 2018. The 2018 season of the league had a
      fairytale ending with another glistening silverware added to the trophy
      cabinet of the Chennai Super Kings. The 2019 edition of the league too saw
      the CSK reach the finals of the tournament under MS Dhoni's leadership.
      While MS Dhoni has hung up his boots on a 16-year illustrious career for
      Team India, he was seen donning the CSK colours once again in 2020.

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      Jadeja's love affair with runs and wickets continued at IPL 2021 and he
      was the highest paid retention for CSK ahead of the 2022 edition of the
      league. The outstanding all-rounder was retained for INR 16 crore.
      Earlier, he became the third retained player by CSK ahead of the IPL 2018
      Player Auction. Ravindra Jadeja has always been MS Dhoni's go-to-man when
      he needed to break a partnership and the left-armer has delivered the
      goods on many occasions. His presence gives Dhoni the extra cushion of
      playing an additional batsman if needed. Jadeja has been an enigma right
      since his advent in international cricket. He was part of the victorious
      Indian U-19 cricket team that won the World Cup in Malaysia in 2008. His
      performance in IPL 2008 helped Rajasthan Royals to title victory and
      earned him the nickname "Rockstar" by his captain Shane Warne. In 2012 IPL
      player auction, Jadeja was bought by Chennai Super Kings for approx. Rs.
      9.8 Crore, making him the most expensive player of the year's auction.
      Jadeja has represented the Gujarat Lions for two seasons and was back with
      CSK for the eleventh edition of the league. He has been an integral part
      of them ever since.

    <img id="shivam" src="./images/chennai/shivam dube.png">
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      A powerful middle-order batter and a handy medium pacer, Shivam Dube was
      bought by CSK for INR 4 crore at the IPL 2022 Mega Auction. What started
      from his base price 50 lakhs and owing to a lot of interest for this
      all-rounder in the auction, it went upto INR 4 cr for Dube. The
      all-rounder who hails from Mumbai has been making headlines for his gritty
      batting and bowling efforts. Shivam Dube had played junior cricket for his
      state before making it to the Mumbai senior team. He made his Twenty20
      debut for Mumbai in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy in January 2016 and a year
      later made his one-day debut for the state team. On the eve of the Player
      Auction prior to IPL 2019, Dube made headlines as he hammered five sixes
      in five balls off left-arm spinner Swapnil Singh on the final day of
      Mumbai's Ranji Trophy match against Baroda. Not surprisingly, he attracted
      fierce bidding at the auction and was eventually signed up by by the Royal
      Challengers Bangalore for a fee of INR 5 cr. After playing for Royal
      Challengers Bangalore over the course of IPL 2019 and IPL 2020, Shivam
      Dube was brought on board by Rajasthan Royals for INR 4.40 Cr. The Indian
      all-rounder has a reputation of being a clean hitter of the cricket ball
      and can be handy with the ball with his medium pace. Dube, who has played
      24 IPL games, will be eager to shine bright for the Chennai franchise in
      the IPL 2022.

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      CSK boy, Deepak Chahar is back with CSK for the 2022 edition of the
      league. It turned out to be fierce bidding war for the swing bowler, with
      SRH and Delhi Capitals starting the bids for Deepak and later were joined
      by RR and CSK for the same. It was as if the CSK had decided to get their
      man back into the ranks and finally succeeded in the same with a price of
      INR 14 crore. The Agra-born medium pacer, Deepak Chahar was a part of the
      Rajasthan Royals squad in 2012, donned the RPS jersey for two seasons and
      was bought by the Chennai Super Kings in the eleventh edition of the
      league. Chahar has risen through the ranks and his ability to swing the
      new ball both ways with control is what makes him a lot more lethal at the
      top. Chahar also possesses the ability to hit handy runs lower down the
      order and his current exploits, a match winning knock against Sri Lanka
      and a 34 ball 54 against South Africa has been the talk of the town. Ahead
      of the 2018 season, Deepak was picked by the Chennai Super Kings and
      medium-pacer had a breakthrough 2018 IPL season taking 10 wickets in 12
      matches. He was then subsequently rewarded with an India call-up in
      limited-overs cricket.
