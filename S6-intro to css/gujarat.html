    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      Opener, Shubman Gill from Punjab, has drawn immense praise from all
      quarters after important contributions in India U19 side's world cup win
      in 2018. He was acquired by the Kolkata Knight Riders in 2018 and turned
      in useful contributions for them in his debut season and 2019 season. He
      was retained by the KKR team management who saw immense batting potential
      in him and even pegged him to be a part of their core leadership group. He
      made his ODI debut for India in New Zealand in 2019, made his Test debut
      in Australia in 2020 and is touted for big things in the future. He was
      however let go off by KKR ahead of the 2022 TATA IPL Auction. Gujarat
      Titans pounced on this opportunity to rope him in their side and could
      well be their opener this season. Gill has the flair and abilities of a
      top-class batter, and one won't be surprised if he delivers for the Titans
      this season.

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      After playing for Kings XI Punjab (now Punjab Kings) over a number of
      years, David Miller was bought by Rajasthan Royals ahead of IPL 2020.
      Despite playing just one game in the IPL 2020, the franchise retained him
      for the IPL 2021, keeping in mind his ability to single-handedly change
      the course of the match. Miller has not got a lot of opportunities with
      the Rajasthan Royals but will be looking to make it count when given a
      chance in the brand new franchise. He still has the experience, game and
      ability to pummel those huge sixes of his reputation and could well be one
      of the game-changers for the Gujarat Titans.

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      Darshan Nalkande has played only a handful of games in domestic cricket
      having broken into first-class cricket with the former Ranji Trophy
      champions Vidarbha. He made an instant impact on his Vijay Hazare Trophy
      debut when he scored an unbeaten 56 from just 30 balls to take Vidarbha to
      an improbable victory over Maharashtra, even though he is known more for
      his skills with the ball. He did not play any games in 2019 and 2020
      seasons but was retained by PBKS ahead of the 2021 IPL auction. This year
      though he will turn up for Gujarat Titans after being sold to the
      franchise for INR 20 Lakh.

    <img id="shami" src="./images/gujarat/shami.png">
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      One of the best India seam bowlers available, Mohammad Shami was bought by
      Gujarat Titans for INR 6.25 crore at the IPL 2022 Mega Auction. Mohammed
      Shami revived his limited-overs career with some stellar performances in
      India colours in recent months and was picked up by Punjab Kings for a
      hefty price tag of INR 4.8 crore at the 2019 Player Auction Shami was
      leading the PBKS pace attack . He has the skills to be effective both at
      the start of the innings and also in the death overs. Shami's progress has
      been terrific and he is now a complete bowler and batsmen will need to be
      wary against him. He had a fine run in 2019 and finished the season as
      KXIP's highest wicket-taker with 19 wickets from 14 games. His bowling got
      even better in the 2020 season where he defended six runs in a super-over
      through his incredible consistency and struck early with the new ball for
      PBKS throughout the 13th edition. This season Shami is all set to don the
      Gujarat Titans jersey and his experience with the new ball will be vital.

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      Versatile with the bat and someone who controls the middle overs with the
      bat, Vijay Shankar was bought by the Gujarat Titans for INR 1.4 crore at
      the IPL 2022 Mega Auction. Vijay Shankar was India's go-to allrounder when
      Hardik Pandya was out of action for Team India. After making his debut in
      ODIs and T20Is for the national side, Shankar has only gone from strength
      to strength in his short stint with the Indian team. A handy bowler, with
      a strong batting technique and electric fielding capabilities, Shankar was
      a regular in the playing XI for the Sunrisers. He would be willing to put
      up more telling performances for his franchise this time around.

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      Arguably the best leg-spinner in white ball cricket, Rashid Khan was
      drafted in the Gujarat Titans squad for INR 15 crore ahead of the IPL 2022
      Mega Auction. Afghanistan leggie, Rashid Khan's story is nothing short of
      a tale of hard work and passion bringing deserved glory. He grew up in a
      war-torn Afghanistan and rose through the ranks by his impressive
      advancements first in tennis ball cricket and then at the higher levels.
      Ever since his debut IPL season in 2017, Rashid has garnered all the right
      eyeballs owing to his mastery with the ball. The leg-spinner turned in a
      few memorable match-winning efforts in SRH's journey to the finals the
      2018 edition. He took 21 wickets and emerged as the second-highest wicket
      taker in that edition. Over the years he has been one of the most sought
      after players in franchise T20 leagues and with a wealth of experience, he
      is definitely a threat to the opposition.
