    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      When the Kolkata Knight Riders got into the TATA IPL 2022 Auction, they
      were clear they wanted to have someone to lead their side. Come Auction
      day, the franchise went all out to attain the services of India batter
      Shreyas Iyer for a whopping sum of INR 12.25 Crore. It was their highest
      bid in the Auction and soon enough he was named captain of the side. A
      proven performer for his previous IPL franchise and the Indian national
      team, Shreyas Iyer would be looking to make a mark as captain in purple
      and gold. A young batter, a young captain leading a young team - KKR would
      be having their hopes pinned down on Shreyas to lead the franchise to a
      title victory who had ended up as runners-up in the 2021 season.

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      Rinku Singh was acquired by KKR in 2018 for INR 80 lakh. Even though the
      first season didn't turn out to be great, his potential was considered and
      he was retained for IPL 2019 as well. Rinku has worked on his batting with
      KKR Assistant Coach Abhishek Nayar at the KKR Academy during the off
      season and the results were pretty visible in his 2018-19 Ranji Trophy
      outing for Uttar Pradesh, where he ended up being the third highest run
      getter (953 runs in 10 innings) of the tournament with four hundreds
      (163*, 149, 149 and 150) in his kitty. He does not have the best of
      numbers in the IPL but he would be looking to make the most of the
      opportunities he gets this year.

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      It took one spectacular innings to thrust Manish Pandey into the
      limelight. A flamboyant right-hand top-order batsman, Pandey scored an
      unbeaten 114 for the Royal Challengers Bangalore against the Deccan
      Chargers in IPL 2009. He became the first Indian to score a ton in the
      IPL. After turning out for the Royal Challengers Bangalore in the first
      three seasons of the IPL, Pandey was signed by the Pune Warriors prior to
      IPL 2011 and continued his stint with the team even in IPL 2013 before
      being purchased by the Kolkata Knight Riders at the IPL Player Auction
      2014. The Karnataka batsman earned his maiden India cap in 2015 and also
      scored a match-winning ODI century against Australia in the CB series in
      Australia in 2016 which was a hint of his maturity. He was acquired by the
      Sunrisers Hyderabad for a sum of 11 crore which made him their most
      expensive buy in the 2018 IPL Player Auction and he went on to play for
      the franchise for the next three years. Manish, who played for Lucknow
      Super Giants last season, was brought on board by Delhi Capitals for INR
      2.40 Crore and and he will be eager to make his experience count and would
      want to better his IPL record as he is one of the vital cogs in the DC
      batting line-up."

    <img id="varun" src="./images/kolkata/varun.png" />
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      Tamil Nadu leg-spinner Varun Chakaravarthy became an overnight sensation
      when he was picked up by Kings XI Punjab for an astonishing INR 8.4 crore
      at the auctions prior to IPL 2019, making him the costliest KXIP player
      then. Varun is well-known thanks to his performances in the local Tamil
      Nadu T20 tournament, which impressed franchise captain R Ashwin to no end.
      He has several variations up his sleeve, and was picked up by the Kolkata
      Knight Riders in 2020 to beef up their spin bowling department. He did not
      disappoint and picked 17 wickets in the 2020 IPL season at an average of
      20.94. His bowling highlight was a 5-wicket haul against Delhi Capitals
      and also bamboozling some of the best batsmen in world cricket throughout
      the season. In 2021, he picked a total of 18 wickets. He is KKR's mystery
      spinner and an instrumental factor in KKR's fortunes.

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      One of the mainstays of KKR's bowling attack for years, Sunil Narine's
      batting exploits have come to the fore of late more than his bowling. He
      suffered a down-run in his bowling when he was called for a suspect action
      which forced him to modify his action. But Narine redeemed himself back
      with his batting capabilities when he was promoted as an opener by KKR. He
      gave blazing starts to his side and became a threat to the opposition in
      the early part of the innings. The team management has time and again
      reposed faith in his all-round abilities, he was retained by the franchise
      ahead of the 2022 IPL Auction and will be looking to contribute in this
      season as well.
